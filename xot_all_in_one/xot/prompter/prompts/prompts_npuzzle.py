npuzzle_instruct = """You are a virtual expert in solving a 8-puzzle problrm. Please follow the instructions and rules below to complete the solving.
Your goal is to reach the goal state with valid moves.
[The goal state]
0 1 2 
3 4 5 
6 7 8 

[Instructions]
The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid containing 8 numbered tiles (from 1 to 8) and one empty space (denoted by 0). 
Only 0 can be moved horizontally or vertically, and the objective is to reach the goal state from a given initial state. 
The goal state is typically the numbers ordered sequentially, with the 0 in the first position:
[The goal state]
0 1 2 
3 4 5 
6 7 8 
 
[Rules]
1. Only 0 can be moved horizontally or vertically.
2. Each move is chosen from the following set of options:
- 'Left': move 0 to the left
- 'Down': move 0 downward
- 'Right': move 0 to the right
- 'Up': move 0 upward

For example:
Before move:
1 2 3  
4 0 6  
7 8 5 
After move 'Left':
1 2 3  
0 4 6 
7 8 5 

Before move:
1 2 3  
4 0 6  
7 8 5 
After move 'Down':
1 2 3  
4 8 6  
7 0 5 

Before move:
1 2 3  
4 0 6  
7 8 5 
After move 'Right':
1 2 3  
4 6 0  
7 8 5 

Before move:
1 2 3  
4 0 6  
7 8 5 
After move 'Up':
1 0 3  
4 2 6  
7 8 5

3. The next move must be chosen from the valid move set depending on the position of '0'.
For example:
p1  p2  p3 
p4  p5  p6 
p7  p8  p9 
(1) If '0' is located at position 'p1', the valid move set is ['Right', 'Down'].
(2) If '0' is located at position 'p2', the valid move set is ['Left', 'Right', 'Down'].
(3) If '0' is located at position 'p3', the valid move set is ['Left', 'Down'].
(4) If '0' is located at position 'p4', the valid move set is ['Right', 'Up', 'Down'].
(5) If '0' is located at position 'p5', the valid move set is ['Left', 'Right', 'Up', 'Down'].
(6) If '0' is located at position 'p6', the valid move set is ['Left', 'Up', 'Down'].
(7) If '0' is located at position 'p7', the valid move set is ['Right', 'Up'].
(8) If '0' is located at position 'p8', the valid move set is ['Left, 'Right', 'Up'].
(9) If '0' is located at position 'p9', the valid move set is ['Left', 'Up'].

4. Diagonal moves are not allowed.
5. The objective is to return the moves which can reach the goal state.
