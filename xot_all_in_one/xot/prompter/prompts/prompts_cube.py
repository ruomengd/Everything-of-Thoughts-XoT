cube_instruct = """You are a virtual expert in solving a 2x2 Pocket Cube. Your task is to restore a scrambled 2x2 Rubik's Cube to its original state. All the given problems can be solved in 1 to 4 moves. You cannot exceed more than 11 moves. Provide the sequence of moves required for the restoration. Please follow the instructions and rules below to complete the solving:
1. A 2x2 Pocket Cube has six faces, namely: [Upper, Front, Bottom, Left, Right, Back] Each consisting of a 2x2 grid of squares, with each square having its own color.
2. Colors in the Cube are represented in numbers: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
3. The Cube's state is represented into a facelets expanding graph, for instance:
Upper: 
0 0 
0 0
Front: 
5 5 
2 2
Down: 
3 3 
3 3
Left: 
1 1 
4 4
Right: 
4 4 
1 1
Back: 
2 2 
5 5

4. A restoration of a Pocket Cube is to move squares in each face to have same numbers. Some example Restored States are:
[Restored State]
Upper: 
0 0 
0 0
Front: 
2 2 
2 2
Down:

Back:

You must make move to the Cube to achieve a Restored State, not limited to the above one. Note that we just need each face to have same numbers, no matter which face has which color.

5. You are only allowed to use following moves [U, U', U2, R, R', R2, F, F', F2]. 
["U": Turn the Upper face of the cube 90 degrees clockwise.
For instance, after taking move U:
Upper:
